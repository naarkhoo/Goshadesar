Despite being slightly colorblind, I’m one of those
people who is bizarrely anal-retentive when it comes to color-schemes in
the software that I use. I use custom CSS extensions in Chrome to make
the color schemes of websites like Wikipedia, Youtube, etc a bit more
pleasing. I did some digging in the accessibility preference pane of
Adobe Reader to make the default document background a nice book-like
sepia tone which makes reading PDFs online a much less straining
endeavor (incidentally - Google Play Books *only* has a white background
which is why I greatly prefer the Amazon Kindle web app). I’ve spent
wayy too long (as I think many geeks do), customizing my terminal and
custom android ROM themes. I think you get the picture.

Some playing around in Xmind (a free, open source mind-mapping software package), here is a side-by-side comparison of 1) the freesurfer workflow as it stands, 2) the workflow as it would be experienced by a user of this parallel-distribution crowdsourcing- with the web platform as a black box, and 3) a slightly more detailed picture of what would be happening with the data. ![Image processing pipeline comparison][1]
